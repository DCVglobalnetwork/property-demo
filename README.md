# 🏠 RealEstate Oracle – UK Property Tokenization

## 🚀 Overview
RealEstate Oracle tokenizes UK property into **digital shares** using blockchain + Chainlink oracles — making real estate investment faster, cheaper, and accessible to everyone.

---

## 📌 Problem
Traditional property investment is:
- Expensive (requires large upfront capital)
- Slow (months of paperwork, legal checks, middlemen)
- Limited to wealthy buyers and institutions

---

## 💡 Solution
- Property owners unlock liquidity by tokenizing assets
- Investors buy shares starting from £100
- Chainlink Functions provide **verifiable property & legal data** on-chain

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Property owner lists property
2. Property is tokenized into 100–1,000 shares
3. Investors purchase tokens
4. Chainlink oracles verify property & legal data
5. Investors earn returns from rent & appreciation

---

## 🎯 Current Focus (Aug → Oct 2025)
- Tokenize 1–3 pilot properties before the **London Blockchain Conference**
- Build investor & property-owner network
- Showcase MVP demo with live tokenized property

---

## 📩 Call to Action
We are looking for:
- 🏠 Property owners/developers to join pilot
- 💰 Investors to participate in fractional ownership
- 🤝 Partners in legal, fintech, and blockchain
